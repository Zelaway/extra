Challenge #1: Generate Lottery numbers file name: lottergamegenerator.html

This assignment took me about 1 hour 33 mins to complete.   I needed to look up a lot on info to refamiliarize myself with 
basic bootstrap and also jquery.   I kept the both the html and js on the same page since this was more of an easier challenge.  But easy is also a relative term since it took me about 1 1/2 hours to fully complete.
